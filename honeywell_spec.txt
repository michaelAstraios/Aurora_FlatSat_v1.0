Input Power

3.2.3.1.1.

Characteristics

Input power requirements are specified in Table 2 - Input Power Requirements. NOTE: Maximum start-up current
draw is highly dependent on the rise time of the user's power supplies. The Max Start-up Current Transient value
listed in Table 2 - Input Power Requirements is valid only for external power supplies where the rise times are ≥2
ms.
Note: It is recommended that the Rate Sensor be powered up with the RESET Input Discrete applied (logic 1,
+3.3V) and then once the external power supply voltage has stabilized within Rate Sensor requirements the
RESET Input Discrete can be de-asserted (logic 0, GND).
If the rise time is longer than 75 msec then the application of the RESET Input Discrete upon power up is required
until the external power supply voltage has stabilized.
The 5V power application to the Rate Sensor should monotonically increase from 1 to 5 volts to ensure proper Rate
Sensor start-up.

Power Connection Equivalent Circuits

Figure 1 - +5 VDC Equivalent Circuit represents the equivalent circuit and should be used during the design
process to determine actual current sourcing requirements for the system. Rapid rise times on power supplies may
cause temporarily excessive current draw due to the nature of the filters present in the Rate Sensor.
Equivalent circuit is given for reference only:

Receive Clock

Not applicable in this configuration.

3.2.3.3.

Serial Data Output

The Rate Sensor shall transmit a RS-422 compatible serial data output signal on the SER_DATA_OUT_H and
SER_DATA_OUT_L pins of the Rate Sensor external interface connector defined in Section 3.2.2 - External
Connector Pin Assignments. [RS_SRS_10128]

3.2.3.4.

Reset Input Discrete

The system shall accept a 3.3 Volt LVCMOS compatible discrete input for hardware reset on the RESET pin of the
Rate Sensor external interface connector defined in Section 3.2.2 - External Connector Pin Assignments.
[RS_SRS_10131]
The RESET input shall tolerate 5 Volt logic input levels. [RS_SRS_10132]

To ensure a reset command is successfully captured and executed by the Rate Sensor, the RESET signal should
be asserted for a minimum of 15 ms. Note that holding RESET at logic 1 during power application does not reduce
the in-rush current.
The RESET input discrete signal is internally pulled to a logic 0 (0 VDC) to allow a no connect (open) at the system
level.

3.2.4.

Serial Data Output Protocol

3.2.4.1.

Serial Communications Controller (SCC) Interface

The Rate Sensor shall transmit a compatible data signal, in accordance with RS-422, on the Serial Data signal
pins, SER_DATA_OUT, of the sensor external interface connector as specified in Section 3.2.2 - External
Connector Pin Assignments. [RS_SRS_10138]
Note: The Rate Sensor utilizes Resistor-Capacitor (RC) source termination on the RS-422 transmitter before the
external interface for signal integrity and EMI reasons. Contact Honeywell for details on source termination
implementation.
The decision to implement a parallel termination resistor at the User’s RS-422 receiver should be informed by User
evaluation of application specific details that influence signal integrity, e.g. cable length, cable construction, and
receiver component capabilities. Honeywell’s Factory and Qualification testing utilized a conventional 120Ω
nominal parallel termination resistor placed between SER_DATA_OUT_H and SER_DATA_OUT_L at the input to
the test equipment’s receiver in accordance with TIA-422.

3.2.4.2.

Asynchronous Protocol

3.2.4.2.1.

General Requirements

Each Asynchronous output frame shall open with a Rate Sensor address byte that can be used as a synching byte,
followed by the information that includes control and data fields. [RS_SRS_10142]
The frame checksum shall follow the data message.
[RS_SRS_10143]
The checksum shall be computed by using a simple 16-bit unsigned integer sum of all bytes included in the
message prior to the checksum itself, with overflows of the 16-bit value being ignored. Twenty-six (26) bytes are

The Rate Sensor has two operational modes: Initialization Mode and Normal Mode. The transition between modes
is shown in Figure 4 - Mode Transition Diagram.

3.2.7.

Fault Detection and Correction (FDC)

The Rate Sensor provides functionality to detect and recover from radiation induced single event upsets or other
non-radiation related fault conditions. This process, referred to as Fault Detection and Correction (FDC),
continuously reads and compares internal register values against their expected values and monitors BIT results for
failed conditions. If an unexpected register value is discovered or a BIT is failed, the Rate Sensor performs a soft
reset to correct the condition and resume normal Rate Sensor operation. The FDC detection process takes
typically 1-10 milliseconds; the timing for reset and recovery is described below.
The Fault Detection and Correction supervisory circuit shall have a turn on time < 1.5ms [RS_SRS_13144]
The Rate Sensor shall detect corrupted internal register values and/or failed BIT and set the Gyro (A/B/C) FDC bit
of Status Word 1 (see Table 7 - Message Information Status Word 1, bit 11, 12, or 13) to annunciate the fault
condition for the affected channel. [RS_SRS_11475]
The RS OK bit of Status Word 1 (see Table 7 - Message Information Status Word 1, bit 15) shall be set when a
corrupted register value or failed BIT is detected. [RS_SRS_11476]
The Rate Sensor shall attempt to recover the corrupted register value or failed BIT by performing an internal soft
reset. [RS_SRS_11477]

Upon restart, the Gyro (A/B/C) FDC bit shall remain set for 1.6 seconds after reaching continuous
mode. [RS_SRS_11479]
Once set, the FDC Failed bit shall persist until the Rate Sensor is soft reset for a separate channel or a separate
cause (e.g. user power cycles the Rate Sensor manually). [RS_SRS_11480]
Once FDC Failed is set, Gyro (A/B/C) FDC shall also persist indicating the failed channel. [RS_SRS_12805]
Note: During a soft reset, there will be a negligible reduction in current consumption and transmission of the Output
Message (see Table 6 - Message Information Field Contents) will temporarily cease. When a soft reset is
performed the Summed Incremental Angles in the output message (see Table 6 - Message Information Field
Contents) reset back to 0. The user will need to update their attitude calculations accordingly.

channel. [RS_SRS_11478]

Section 3.8.2 Maintainability

6.2.1.

Gyro Performance Parameters

Gyro performance definitions in this section apply to the body angular rate (b) and incremental angle () outputs
of the Rate Sensor. Note that the  outputs are equivalent to an angular rate output when divided by the
corresponding output sampling interval t. The  and b are computed from the same basic sensor
measurements, but the b outputs may be digitally filtered in the Rate Sensor to shape the frequency response and
reduce noise. In addition, the b output will not incorporate coning corrections.

6.2.1.1.

Gyro Bias Error

The deterministic component of gyro output measured at specified operating conditions that has no correlation with
input rotation or acceleration. Bias is typically expressed in °/hr.

6.2.1.1.1.

Gyro Bias Stability (In Run Stability)

In-run gyro bias stability is a measure of random variation in bias as computed over a specified sample time and
averaging time interval. This non-stationary (evolutionary) process is characterized by 1/f power spectral density. It
is typically expressed in °/hr.

6.2.1.1.2.

Gyro Bias Repeatability

6.2.1.2.

Gyro Output Scale Factor

Gyro output scale factor is a measure of the change in the slope of the straight line that can be fitted by the method
of least squares of the angular rate input-output data. It is defined as ppm error of the output.

6.2.1.2.1.

Gyro Scale Factor Repeatability

Gyro SF repeatability is defined as the residual output SF error, as defined in Section 6.2.1.2 - Gyro Output Scale
Factor, after calibration and internal compensation, including the effects of turn-off and turn-on, time, radiation, and
temperature variations. The repeatability error is expressed in ppm of the output angular rate.

6.2.1.2.2.

Gyro Scale Factor Linearity

Gyro SF linearity is a measure of the one sigma deviation of the output from the least squares linear fit of the inputoutput data expressed in ppm of the output.

6.2.1.2.3.

Gyro Scale Factor In-Run Stability

In-run gyro scale factor stability is a measure of random variation in the sensitivity of the gyro. It is typically
assessed at a constant temperature and constant angular rate. The instability is found at the minimum of the Allan
Deviation. It is expressed in ppm.

6.2.1.3.

Gyro Noise (Angle Random Walk)

Gyro noise can consist of multiple types that are typically differentiated from each other by their spectral content.
The most significant type is often the angular random walk (ARW), which is characterized as the relatively wide
band (i.e. “white”) noise on angular rate output. ARW is the angular error buildup with time due to white noise in
angular rate expressed in °/√hr.

6.2.1.4.

Gyro Frequency Response

The gyro frequency response is defined as the total Rate Sensor transfer function, from angular rate input to digital
rate data (rate or ) output. This includes the isolator, the actual rate sensor, the Rate Sensor processing delay,
any incorporated filters, the sampling effect of the output message rate, and the transport lag for the serial
transmission.

Gyro bias repeatability is defined as the residual output bias error after calibration and internal compensation,
including the effects of turn-off and turn-on, time, radiation, and temperature variations. This measure represents
the statistical expected value for output bias error at any given time and thermal condition.

6.2.1.5.

Gyro Operating Rate Range

Gyro operating rate range is the maximum angular rate input in both directions to which the Rate Sensor rate
output (rate or ) performance parameters apply.

6.2.1.6.

Rate Sensor Alignment

The mathematical Rate Sensor alignment error model is shown in Figure 14 - Rate Sensor Alignment Error Model.
It consists of Mount-to-Mount, Axes Alignment Stability to Case, and Axes Non-Orthogonality error components.
Mount-to-Mount is a largely temperature-independent alignment error due to Rate Sensor mounting pin-hole
diameter and positional tolerance and Rate Sensor housing flatness and angularity.
Axes Alignment Stability to Case is a largely temperature-dependent gyro reference frame alignment error due to
the rigid motion of the Rate Sensor on its isolation system.

Axes Non-Orthogonality is largely a temperature-dependent alignment error with respect to the orthogonal gyro
reference frame due to residual (uncompensated) motion of the individual gyro mounting surfaces with respect to
each other.
