DATA MISALIGNMENT RISK ANALYSIS
=====================================

Topic: Risk of data being received for wrong measurement in FlatSat Device Simulator

QUESTION:
The sensors send data as a packet with x, y, and z all together. Since the data from the MATLAB simulator comes in on separate ports, what is the likelihood of data being received for the wrong measurement?

DATA FLOW ANALYSIS
------------------

Current Architecture:
MATLAB Simulator → TCP/IP → Device Encoders → Output Transmitters

Data Timing Characteristics:
1. MATLAB Sender: Sends 8-byte floats every 10ms with precise timing
2. TCP/IP: Network packets can arrive out of order or with delays
3. Device Processing: Each device processes data independently

RISK ASSESSMENT: DATA MISALIGNMENT
-----------------------------------

High Risk Scenarios:

1. Network Packet Reordering:
   - TCP can deliver packets out of order
   - If X, Y, Z arrive in different network packets, timing could be off
   - Likelihood: Medium-High (depends on network conditions)

2. Processing Delays:
   - If one port's data is delayed in processing
   - Could cause X, Y, Z to be from different time periods
   - Likelihood: Medium (depends on system load)

3. Buffer Overflow:
   - If one port's buffer fills up faster
   - Could cause data to be dropped or delayed
   - Likelihood: Low-Medium (depends on data rates)

CURRENT MITIGATION (What We Have):
----------------------------------

1. Sequential Port Processing: Each device processes its ports in order
2. Timing Validation: We check for 10ms intervals between data
3. Data Validation: We validate float values (NaN, infinity checks)

MISSING MITIGATION (What We Need):
----------------------------------

1. Packet Synchronization: No mechanism to ensure X, Y, Z are from same time period
2. Timestamp Matching: No way to verify data is temporally aligned
3. Sequence Numbers: No sequence tracking across ports

RECOMMENDATIONS TO REDUCE RISK:
-------------------------------

Option 1: Add Timestamp Synchronization
```python
# Add timestamp to each float when received
# Only process X, Y, Z if timestamps are within tolerance
if abs(timestamp_x - timestamp_y) < 0.001 and abs(timestamp_y - timestamp_z) < 0.001:
    process_data(x, y, z)
```

Option 2: Add Sequence Numbers
```python
# MATLAB sends sequence number with each float
# Only process if sequence numbers match
if seq_x == seq_y == seq_z:
    process_data(x, y, z)
```

Option 3: Single Packet Approach
```python
# MATLAB sends X, Y, Z in single packet (24 bytes)
# Eliminates port-based misalignment risk
```

CURRENT RISK LEVEL: MEDIUM-HIGH
-------------------------------

Why: Without synchronization mechanisms, there's a reasonable chance that X, Y, Z measurements could be from different time periods, especially under network stress or high system load.

Impact: This could cause:
- Incorrect sensor readings
- Invalid packet generation
- Potential test failures

CONCLUSION:
-----------
The current architecture has a medium-high risk of data misalignment due to the separate port approach. Implementing one of the recommended mitigation strategies would significantly reduce this risk and improve data integrity.

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:
-----------------------
1. Implement timestamp synchronization for all devices
2. Add sequence number tracking across ports
3. Consider single-packet approach for critical measurements
4. Add data integrity validation before packet encoding
