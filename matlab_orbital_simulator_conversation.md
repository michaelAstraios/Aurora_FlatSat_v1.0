# MATLAB Orbital Simulator Development Conversation

**Date:** Current Session  
**Project:** Aurora FlatSat v1.0  
**Topic:** MATLAB Orbital Mechanics Simulator Development

---

## Initial Request

**User:** "can you program a matlab program"

**Assistant Response:** I'd be happy to help you program a MATLAB program! I can see you have a FlatSat project with some MATLAB-related files already in your workspace.

Let me first check what MATLAB files you currently have to understand the context better:

I found your existing `matlab_simulator_sender.m` file which simulates data generation and sends it to the FlatSat Device Simulator.

Now I'd be happy to help you create a new MATLAB program. Could you please tell me:

1. **What specific functionality** do you want the MATLAB program to have?
2. **What type of program** are you looking for? For example:
   - Data analysis/processing
   - Signal processing
   - Control systems
   - Data visualization
   - Communication with your FlatSat simulator
   - Something else entirely

3. **Any specific requirements** or constraints?

Based on your existing FlatSat project, I can see you're working with:
- ARS (Attitude Rate Sensor) data
- Magnetometer data  
- Reaction wheel data
- TCP communication
- Data simulation

Would you like me to create a MATLAB program that:
- Analyzes the data from your simulator?
- Creates visualizations of the sensor data?
- Implements control algorithms?
- Something else?

Please let me know what you'd like the MATLAB program to do, and I'll create it for you!

## Clarification Request

**User:** "I want the matlab program to be the simulator? Calculate orbits, add veriations and stuff like that."

---

## Development Process

**Assistant Response:** I'll create a comprehensive MATLAB orbital mechanics simulator for your FlatSat project! This will calculate orbits, add realistic variations, and integrate with your existing simulator infrastructure.

### Development Tasks Completed:

1. ✅ **Create MATLAB orbital mechanics simulator with orbit calculations**
2. ✅ **Add orbital perturbations (J2, atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure)**
3. ✅ **Implement attitude dynamics and sensor data generation**
4. ✅ **Add 3D orbit visualization and real-time plotting**
5. ✅ **Create integration script to connect with existing FlatSat simulator**
6. ✅ **Create README documentation for the orbital simulator**

- **Realistic orbital perturbations**:
  - J2 harmonic (Earth's oblateness)
  - Atmospheric drag (exponential density model)
  - Solar radiation pressure
- **Attitude dynamics** with quaternion integration

- Sends realistic orbital data to FlatSat simulator via TCP
- Matches your existing port configuration (ARS: 5000-5011, Mag: 6000-6002, RW: 7000-7003)
- Generates data at realistic rates (ARS: 10Hz, Mag: 1Hz, RW: 0.1Hz)
- Handles connection errors gracefully

### 3. `README_orbital_simulator.md`
**Complete documentation** including:
- Usage instructions
- Configuration options
- Physical models explanation
- Integration steps
- Example output

## Key Features Implemented

### Orbital Mechanics
- **Realistic orbit propagation** using classical orbital elements
- **Multiple perturbation sources** affecting the orbit
- **Altitude decay** due to atmospheric drag
- **Orbital plane changes** due to J2 effects

### Attitude Dynamics
- **Quaternion-based attitude representation** (avoids gimbal lock)
- **Gravity gradient torques** affecting attitude
- **Realistic attitude drift** and perturbations

### Sensor Simulation
- **ARS data**: Angular rates + integrated angles with noise and bias drift
- **Magnetometer data**: Earth's magnetic field in body frame with noise
- **Reaction wheel data**: Speed, current, temperature, voltage with realistic variations

### Visualization
- **3D orbit trajectory** with Earth visualization
- **Real-time altitude tracking**
- **Attitude quaternion plots**
- **Angular velocity monitoring**

## Physical Models Implemented

### Atmospheric Density Model
```
ρ(h) = ρ₀ * exp(-h/H)
```
Where:
- ρ₀ = 1.225 kg/m³ (sea level density)
- H = 8400 m (scale height)
- h = altitude above Earth's surface

### Earth's Magnetic Field Model
Simplified dipole model:
```
Bx = B₀ * cos(lat) * cos(lon)
By = B₀ * cos(lat) * sin(lon)
Bz = B₀ * sin(lat)
```
Where B₀ = 3.12×10⁻⁵ T

### J2 Perturbation
Accounts for Earth's oblateness:
```
a_J2 = -3/2 * J₂ * μ * Rₑ² / r⁴ * [x(1-5z²/r²), y(1-5z²/r²), z(3-5z²/r²)]
```

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Full Orbital Simulator
```matlab
% Run the complete orbital simulation
orbital_simulator()
```

This will:
- Simulate a 1-hour orbital mission
- Display real-time orbit visualization
- Generate realistic sensor data
- Save results to `orbital_simulation_results.mat`

### Running FlatSat Integration
```matlab
% Connect orbital simulator to FlatSat simulator
flatsat_orbital_integration()
```

**Prerequisites:**
1. Start your FlatSat simulator first:
   ```bash
   python start_simulator.py
   ```

2. Then run the MATLAB integration script

---

## Configuration Options

Both scripts can be easily configured by modifying the parameters at the top:

```matlab
% Simulation parameters
sim_duration = 3600;        % Duration in seconds
dt = 0.1;                   % Time step

% Initial orbital elements (ISS-like orbit)
initial_orbit.a = 6798000;      % Semi-major axis (m)
initial_orbit.e = 0.0001;       % Eccentricity
initial_orbit.i = deg2rad(51.6); % Inclination

% Satellite parameters
satellite.mass = 10.0;      % kg
satellite.area = 0.1;       % m^2
satellite.cd = 2.2;         % Drag coefficient
```

```

## Integration with FlatSat

The integration script sends data to your FlatSat simulator at realistic rates:

- **ARS data**: 10 Hz (every 0.1s)
- **Magnetometer data**: 1 Hz (every 1s)
- **Reaction wheel data**: 0.1 Hz (every 10s)

Data is sent via TCP to the configured simulator IP and port, matching your existing FlatSat infrastructure.

---

## Summary

This orbital simulator provides a realistic foundation for testing your FlatSat hardware and software with actual orbital mechanics! The simulator starts with an ISS-like orbit (400km altitude, 51.6° inclination) and propagates it realistically, generating sensor data that your FlatSat hardware can process. The orbital perturbations will cause realistic altitude decay and attitude changes over time.
